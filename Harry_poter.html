            <h2>Synopsis</h2>
            <p>In the second book of the <em>Harry Potter</em> series, Harry returns to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry for his second year. Strange and dangerous events unfold as the Chamber of Secrets, a hidden chamber within Hogwarts, is opened, unleashing a monster that petrifies several students.</p>
            <p>Harry discovers that he can speak Parseltongue (the language of snakes), which leads some students to suspect him of being responsible. Together with Ron and Hermione, Harry unravels the mystery of the chamber, eventually discovering that it was opened by Ginny Weasley under the influence of Tom Riddle&rsquo;s enchanted diary&mdash;a fragment of Voldemort&rsquo;s soul.</p>
            <p>The climax reveals that the monster in the chamber is a deadly Basilisk, which Harry defeats with the help of Fawkes, Dumbledore&rsquo;s phoenix, and the magical sword of Godric Gryffindor.</p>
