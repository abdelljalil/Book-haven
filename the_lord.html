            <h2>Plot Synopsis</h2>
            <p>Centuries ago, an enigmatic sorcerer named Eryndor claimed dominion over the rulers of the land, earning the ominous title, <em>The Lord of the Kings</em>. Through a mix of ancient magic and masterful manipulation, he bound the kings to a secret pact, ensuring their loyalty. Over generations, this pact became an unbroken chain, cementing his shadowy rule.</p>
            <p>But a prophecy whispers of a "Breaker of Chains," a chosen individual destined to shatter Eryndor's control. When Prince Kael of Aedryn uncovers forbidden scrolls detailing the sorcerer's machinations, he realizes the depth of the tyranny gripping his world. Driven by a thirst for justice, Kael rallies an unlikely band of allies&mdash;a rogue knight, a seer burdened by haunting visions, and a thief with knowledge of Eryndor's hidden weaknesses.</p>
            <p>Together, they must navigate a treacherous journey across the fractured kingdoms to recover the mythical <em>Crown of Light</em>, the only artifact capable of nullifying Eryndor's powers. Along the way, they face betrayal, internal discord, and the lure of forbidden power.</p>
